> [!Tip] Windows, tabs and buffers 

> Vim handles files through a combination of **buffers**, **windows**, and **tabs**.

> Buffers :
> - A buffers is the in-memory text of a file which is loaded into memory for editing.
> - Buffers can be empty or contain some text 
> - Two windows containing the same file (see below) are both modifying the same buffer.

> Windows :
> - You can have multiple windows into a single buffer (see above) at the same location or a different location
> - You can also have multiple windows into multiple buffers.

> Tabs:
> - Tabs are containers for windows. 
> - You can have multiple tabs open, each containing one or more windows.
