# About

This config was born out of frustration with lunarvim's lsp system ( https://www.lunarvim.org ), specifically how to use it and remove preconfigured stuff.
I went from not knowing anything about vim (hence the moving from community distro to distro) and i finally just decided to make one myself, for this reason i have tried to make this config as self-explanatory and intuitive as possible with **relatively** good explanations of what everything is doing
